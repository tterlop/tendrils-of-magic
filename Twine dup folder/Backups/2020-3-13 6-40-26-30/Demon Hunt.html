The town is home to less than a hundred people. It&#39;s quiet and gloomy with horse droppings on the road and strange smells mingling in the air. There seems to be a constant wave of dark storm clouds hovering overhead.

You&#39;re at the gates to enter. There is a gruff-looking gatekeeper just ahead. Where will you go?

[[Approach the gatekeeper]]
[[Sneak in]]

[[References]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Approach the gatekeeper" tags="" position="364,265" size="100,100">You run into the gatekeeper. He doesn&#39;t look happy to see you.

&quot;You&#39;re not from around here,&quot; he growls. &quot;Get outta town! We don&#39;t like outsiders!&quot;

Startled, you turn and leave. Maybe if you try going the other direction, you&#39;ll have more luck.

[[Go the other direction|Sneak in]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Sneak in" tags="" position="497,188" size="100,100">There&#39;s a narrow passage behind some large crates that provides a secret way to sneak in without alerting the gatekeeper. You slip through and he doesn&#39;t notice.

As soon as you&#39;re far enough away to not be noticed by him, you step out into the open. Your eyes scan the few shops that are in the town circle. There&#39;s only one title you&#39;re looking for.

Suddenly, a man approaches you. He&#39;s small and stout and looks suspicous.

&quot;You&#39;re not from around here.&quot;

[[How can you tell?]]
[[Sure I am. I&#39;m visiting my cousin.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="How can you tell?" tags="" position="474,351" size="100,100">Just wait right here. Don&#39;t go anywhere. I&#39;m getting Marvin, the gatekeeper. He&#39;ll sort you out.

You attempt to flee, but other townsfolk give you away. You beg for your life when you realize they intend to kill you, the gatekeeper approaching with a morning star, but it&#39;s too late.

The first blow ends you.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Sure I am. I&#39;m visiting my cousin." tags="" position="624,351" size="100,100">&quot;Your cousin, you say?&quot; the man asks. &quot;What&#39;s his name?&quot;

[[The one and only witch doctor in town!]]
[[It&#39;s uh--err--you know--Tom Thumb.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="The one and only witch doctor in town!" tags="" position="549,501" size="100,100">&quot;Alima Firebelly? That witch doctor?&quot; the man asks. &quot;Wow. I didn&#39;t know she had any family. Well, if you&#39;re one of hers, you must mean well. Hey, next time you see her, tell her I - Tom Thumb - would love to get a reading from her. I&#39;d pay good money for it, too.&quot;

Tom Thumb turns with a wave and leaves you be. You breathe a sigh of relief and head out to look for Alima Firebelly&#39;s shop. When you finally find it in the quiet east corner of town, you take a breath and inspect the place.

The shop is small, established on a raised platform with a set of shoddy stairs leading  up to the front door. There are windows, but they&#39;re covered from the inside with black curtains. A chimney on the roof coughs out puffs of purple smoke.

Suddenly, an eerie humming sound resonates from the inside.

[[It&#39;s too scary. Time to turn back.]]
[[This is just what you need to rid yourself of that pesky pursuer.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="It&#39;s uh--err--you know--Tom Thumb." tags="" position="699,501" size="100,100">&quot;Tom Thumb, huh?&quot; the man asks. &quot;Well, it just so happens MY name is Tom Thumb. Now you&#39;ve //REALLY// pissed me off...!&quot;

As you back away, the man comes forward, revealing under his robe a magic wand. You cower in fear because everyone knows there&#39;s nothing more painful and brutal a death than feeling the ferocious fires of magic.

It&#39;s a slow death for you.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="It&#39;s too scary. Time to turn back." tags="" position="474,651" size="100,100">You turn back and leave town. You wait in the woods outside of town for your ultimate fate to come find you.

You&#39;re prepared to fight him, but you don&#39;t know what to expect when IT is far more powerful than you are.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="This is just what you need to rid yourself of that pesky pursuer." tags="" position="624,651" size="100,100">&lt;audio autoplay&gt;\&lt;source src=&quot;Assets/outdoormusic.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
You walk up the steps to the front door. It smells of sage and other powerful herbs. You rap on the door a few times and the mysterious humming stops. Footsteps approach and the door is slowly opened. Two piercing blue eyes stare out at you from within the shadows of the home.

&quot;Are you the witch doctor?&quot; you ask.

&quot;Who&#39;s asking?&quot; she replies, a voice rough as sand paper.

[[Don&#39;t toy with me. Just tell me it&#39;s you.]]
[[My name is Gretta and I need your help.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Don&#39;t toy with me.

It&#39;s time someone teach you some manners!&quot;

The witch doctor grabs you by the throat and pulls you inside. Your fate in that little tribal house is far to dark and twisted to repeat. Moral of the story: Never offend a witch doctor.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="My name is Gretta and I need your help." tags="" position="724,807" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Assets/ghost.jpg&quot;&gt;

&quot;What brings you here?&quot; the witch doctor asks.

&quot;I&#39;m being hunted by a demon,&quot; you explain. &quot;His name is Kerr. He&#39;s a crossroads demon I made a deal with for my soul. But when I fulfilled my terms, he went back on his, and now he&#39;s hunting me down to take my soul. I&#39;m trying to find a way to fight back. I was told you might be able to help.&quot;

The witch doctor smiles, teeth filed to jagged little sharp points. She opens the door and invites you in. You hesitate a moment.

[[Maybe I should get to know her better first, you think to yourself.]]
[[No time like the present.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Maybe I should get to know her better first, you think to yourself." tags="" position="583,917" size="100,100">&quot;Actually, is there any way we can do this outside?&quot; you ask.

The witch doctor giggles. &quot;Scared? I understand. But it&#39;s not me you need to be afraid of. If I were being hunted down by Kerr, I wouldn&#39;t exactly spit in the face of the one trying to help me.

You shrug to yourself. She&#39;s absolutely right.

[[No time like the present.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="No time like the present." tags="" position="725,932" size="100,100">You step inside, inhaling the powerful, bizarre odors permeating the air. Old furniture is carelessly arranged in the room with royal purple tapestries hung along the walls and floor.

Alima invites you to sit at a table with a crystal ball on it. You have a seat.

&quot;I have just the thing to deal with a crossroads demon,&quot; she says. &quot;Wait right here.&quot;

She scuttles off and leaves you alone in the room.

[[Time to do some snooping. Maybe I will find something useful.]]
[[Just sit and stay put.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Time to do some snooping. Maybe I will find something useful." tags="" position="650,1082" size="100,100">You get up and start investigating some of the books the witch doctor has. You pick a rather old one off the shelf and open it. The pages stretch out, slapping you on the face and adhering to your skin.

You panic and drop the book, but it remains attached to your face, slowly beginning to swallow you. As it consumes you, through your screams, you hear the witch doctors laughter.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Just sit and stay put." tags="" position="800,1082" size="100,100">You sit in silence and observe your creepy surroundings. Animals skulls adorning the shelves, black candles everywhere. There&#39;s a chill in the air and you&#39;re happy when Alima returns.

She approaches you with something wrapped in a cloth.

&quot;Use this when the time comes. You&#39;ll know what to do with it...I hope,&quot; the witch doctor says.&quot;

You accept the mystery item. Alima simply stands there and stares at you.

[[You head to the front door.]]
[[Of course, you have to pay her.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="You head to the front door." tags="" position="725,1232" size="100,100">&quot;Excuse me, Gretta, but nothing in this world is for free.

[[Of course, you have to pay her.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Of course, you have to pay her." tags="" position="875,1232" size="100,100">&lt;audio autoplay&gt;\&lt;source src=&quot;Assets/leaves.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;

You fish through the pouch on your hip and dig out some copper pieces.

&quot;It&#39;s all I have,&quot; you said.

Alima doesn&#39;t look pleased, but she takes it. &quot;Go now,&quot; she says. &quot;I can feel IT coming closer. I don&#39;t want it find me when it arrives.&quot;

You take your leave, quickly escaping the town. Now, to find Kerr.

[[Into the woods]]

There are no paths in these woods, but you know where you&#39;re going. You merely need to find the ringing in your ears.

The demon is close. You can sense that.

You walk for hours until your stomach growls and you feel faint from lack of food. As you settle down for a break, you hear nails scraping wood. Sounds like something is clawing at the ground.

[[You go to investigate.]]
[[Nevermind that. I&#39;ll just mind my own business.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="You go to investigate." tags="" position="800,1532" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Assets/squirrel.jpg&quot;&gt;

You go to check out the noise and it&#39;s not long before you find the source. A squirrel has been caught in a trap. It&#39;s brown fur is caked with dried mud as the trap is half sunk in a mudpit after the rain.

[[Time for dinner.]]
[[Release it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Nevermind that. I&#39;ll just mind my own business." tags="" position="950,1532" size="100,100">You ignore the scratching and go on your way. But it&#39;s not long before you feel yourself growing woozy. The world spins around you and you collapse. Dehydration and lack of food has caught up to you.

Who knows how long you&#39;ll be out? Now you&#39;re fair game for any animals.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Time for dinner." tags="" position="735,1691" size="100,100">You know it&#39;s not your catch, but you&#39;re just //so// hungry. You fight to pull the trap out of the mud. It&#39;s released with a loud slapping sound.

A while later, you&#39;re busy cooking your squirrel and don&#39;t hear the footsteps coming up behind you through the crackling fire. Something blunt cracks you on the head.

Now you&#39;re someone else&#39;s prisoner.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Release it." tags="" position="875,1682" size="100,100">You unlatch the trap and release the squirrel. It scurries off into the bush and up a tree. It&#39;s then that you notice the unattended rucksacks at a small campground just ahead.

You approach and call out for anyone, desperate for something to eat. When no one replies, you do some digging and find some scraps which you quickly gobble up.

It&#39;s not long before you notice a group of men coming through the woods.

&lt;img src=&quot;Assets/hunters.jpg&quot;&gt;

[[Run away while you have the chance.]]
[[Try to talk to them.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Run away while you have the chance." tags="" position="800,1832" size="100,100">Your instincts tell you to run.

[[Turn around.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Try to talk to them." tags="" position="950,1832" size="100,100">&lt;audio autoplay&gt;\&lt;source src=&quot;Assets/leaves.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;

You approach them and tell them you need a meal. They all seemed surprised to see you and stop in their tracks. They don&#39;t say anything and you wonder if maybe you should&#39;ve stayed hidden.

That&#39;s when you hear leaves crunching behind you.

[[Turn around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Turn around." tags="" position="950,1982" size="100,100">You turn and find another man aiming an arrow at your chest.

&quot;Simmer down there, lasse,&quot; he says with a crooked smile.

&quot;Let me go. You don&#39;t want to mess with me,&quot; you say.

The man laughs softly. He gestures for you to step back and have a seat. Without much choice, you do as he says. The other men arrive and you find yourself in a bit of trouble.

[[Say something.]]
[[Cry for help.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Cry for help." tags="" position="950,2132" size="100,100">You start screaming your head off, shouting for help until you&#39;re blue in the face. But the man with the bow takes none of that. He draws back on the bow string and shoots you in the chest. You collapse and bleed out right in front of them.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Say something." tags="" position="838,2118" size="100,100">&quot;Listen,&quot; you say. &quot;I don&#39;t want any trouble. I just wanted a bite to eat. But trust me. If you know what&#39;s good for you, you&#39;ll let me go.&quot;

The men have a good laugh. They&#39;re all hunters, armed with weapons, nets, and rope. Hunters of one kind or another, anyway.

&quot;So what have you got on you, dear?&quot; one man says. &quot;Silver? Gold?&quot;

[[Give them what little you have.]]
[[Give them something more.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Give them what little you have." tags="" position="763,2268" size="100,100">You dig into your satchel and pull out the remaining copper you have. It&#39;s not much and they know it.

&quot;What else ya got?&quot; another man asks.

You realize these men will not be easily appeased. You might have to break out something bigger. Something to //really// show them.

&quot;Well?&quot; he pushes.

&quot;Okay...&quot; you say.

[[Give them something more.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Give them something more." tags="" position="913,2268" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Assets/bible.jpg&quot;&gt;

From your satchel, you pull out a book. It&#39;s an old, tattered thing that once was a lovely bible. To whom it belonged, you don&#39;t know, but now, it keeps the picture of Kerr. It&#39;s the only picture of him known to exist. A crude sketch done by yourself.

Before the men can comment, you open the book to the page and a sudden wind sweeps across the campground. The men shiver and recoil, evidently terrified. As they should be.

&quot;Get out of here with that!&quot; the man with the bow orders. He backs away steadily. &quot;Go! Go away! Get out of here!&quot;

The men aim their weapons at you. You jump to your feet.

[[Terrify them some more.]]
[[Get the hell out of their.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Terrify them some more." tags="" position="838,2418" size="100,100">With a newfound grit, you rise to your feet brandishing the book. You continue flashing Kerr&#39;s face in their direction.

They scream and raise their weapons. One of them hurls a knife at you. The last thing you remember is the sharp pain as it pierces your chest.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Get the hell out of their." tags="" position="988,2418" size="100,100">You don&#39;t waste any time. You shove the book in your satchel and tear out of there like a banshee through the woods. When you&#39;re far enough away that you can no longer see them, you stop for a break.

You&#39;re dripping in sweat and your heart is pounding, but you&#39;re glad you made it out alive. It&#39;s nearing night now, but that&#39;s when Kerr likes coming out the most. He&#39;ll find you tonight. You can feel it.

[[Have a cat nap.]]
[[Wait for him.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Have a cat nap." tags="" position="913,2568" size="100,100">Death comes swiftly in the night, while you&#39;re dreaming. You&#39;ve lost your chance to win back your soul. He caught you.

It&#39;s a soft, gentle night, not what you&#39;d expect to be the grounds for a great approaching battle. You sit in the silence of the woods, waiting.

You&#39;re prepared. You&#39;re eager.
You&#39;re terrified.

It&#39;s not long before you can sense the demon&#39;s arrival. Your hand clutches the secret item you got from the witch doctor. To be used only when the time is right.

And then you hear something. A whisper in the dark.

[[Stand to confront him.]]
[[Take out Alima&#39;s item.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Stand to confront him." tags="" position="988,2718" size="100,100">&quot;Kerr. You went back on the deal. You won&#39;t take my soul. I won&#39;t allow it,&quot; you announce.

He hasn&#39;t made his presence known yet. He&#39;s just listening, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike.

&quot;Come face me, coward! Fight for what you want!&quot;

There&#39;s a loud howl of wind and you see the demon approaching in a blur of smoky blackness. You&#39;re prepared to fight and take him head on.

[[Deal the first blow.]]
[[Brace for impact.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Take out Alima&#39;s item." tags="" position="1138,2718" size="100,100">You panic and tear out Alima&#39;s item, unwrapping it. Before you can see what it is, something startles you and you drop it in the grass. You drop to your knees, grabbing for it on the ground.

Giving Kerr just enough opportunity to take your soul forever and leave you a pile of bones in these mysterious woods.

[[Start Over|Welcome to Demon Hunt]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Deal the first blow." tags="" position="913,2868" size="100,100">You miss!

And he rams you into a tree. The breath is knocked right out of you. You get yourself together, feeling light-headed and severely weakened. You should&#39;ve known better than to be so bold.

He comes at you with everything he&#39;s got and you just have to deal with it.

[[Brace for impact.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Brace for impact." tags="" position="1063,2868" size="100,100">You cross both arms in front of you and grit your teeth. Kerr rams against you and your feet leaves trails in the ground. You can feel his hot breath, listen to his snarling. And there&#39;s those two red eyes piercing your soul.

You kick him in the gut and he stumbles back. Then the real battle begins. It&#39;s a vicious struggle on both sides and you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re going to make it out alive. You fight for your life, because that&#39;s all you have left.

Fresh slices from his claws open up your skin on your arms and stomach. It stings, but you hardly feel it. The night remains dark and the battle happens in a total void of all senses but for sound and touch.

[[Use Alima&#39;s item.]]
[[Duke it out a little longer.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Use Alima&#39;s item." tags="" position="988,3018" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;Assets/compass.jpg&quot;&gt;

It&#39;s just the right time. You can feel it!

You reach into your satchel just as Kerr races up to you, and unwrap the item. To your confusion, you see it&#39;s an ancient type of compass. But you don&#39;t ask any questions. You aim it at Kerr.

The demon&#39;s expression of joy fades until he looks simply horrified. The compass activates in that moment when he&#39;s just close enough and a light breaks out of it, enveloping Kerr.

The demon screams. &quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!&quot;

You don&#39;t full grasp what&#39;s happening, but let it happen anyway. As the seconds pass, a searing heat burns your palms.

[[Wait for the compass to finish destroying Kerr.]]
[[The pain in your hands is too much. You drop the compass.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Duke it out a little longer." tags="" position="1138,3018" size="100,100">You fight longer into the night, dealing blows and slashing with your shortsword. But it&#39;s not long before you realize your mistake. You should&#39;ve used Alima&#39;s item when you had the energy.

Now you&#39;re faint and tired and can barely stand to take another shot.

Kerr quickly weakens you, full of supernatural energy.

&quot;You&#39;re fading,&quot; he says with a cackle.

You dig into that last reserve of strength.

&quot;Don&#39;t doubt me just yet, hellspawn!&quot; you shout.

[[Use Alima&#39;s item.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Wait for the compass to finish destroying Kerr." tags="" position="913,3168" size="100,100">&lt;audio autoplay&gt;\&lt;source src=&quot;Assets/roar.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;

Light wraps around Kerr like ribbons. He hates every moment of it and screams the entire time, cursing you to die. But you don&#39;t die. You live, even after the compass finishes swallowing Kerr and he&#39;s gone for good.

&quot;What the heck just happened?&quot; you ask yourself. The white light is gone and now the compass sits in your hand, plain and seemingly useless. You stare at it a moment longer, still trying to make sense of it all.

&quot;It&#39;s an enchanted piece,&quot; a voice says from behind you. You spin around and see Alima, the witch doctor. She steps forward, appearing from out of nowhere it seems. The older woman smiles, eyes on the compass. She reaches and takes it from you, her soft skin brushing yours.

&quot;What happened to him?&quot; you ask.

&quot;This compass has trapped him in a loop. An everturning loop. And he&#39;ll stay there. Forever.&quot; Alima hides the compass under her robe. &quot;I knew you could do it.&quot;

&quot;And now my soul is my own,&quot; you say.

Alima nods. &quot;So go live your life. Let nothing hold you back.&quot;

[[Epilogue]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="The pain in your hands is too much. You drop the compass." tags="" position="1063,3168" size="100,100">The moment the compass hits the ground, you shrink back, your hands exploding in pain. You can practically hear the flesh sizzle and smell cooked meat.

But in that moment, you hear the crack of the compass, and witness Kerr slipping back out of it.

He&#39;s angrier than ever now. And you have nothing left to fight with.
